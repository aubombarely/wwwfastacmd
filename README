wwwfastacmd are four files to add to wwblast NCBI tool, to be able to use
fastacmd through a web interface, in other words, to be able to retrieve
a sequence from a blastdb based in its ID.

This web interface use the same strcuture than wwwblast. It has two important 
files:

  * fastacmd.html, with the form to submit the query.

  * fastacmd.cgi, with all the code to check the submitted data and 
    the line to executate the fastacmd. It is performed using `STRING`
    (http://perldoc.perl.org/perlop.html#%60STRING%60), instead system
    to avoid the creation of any temp file. The output is directly redirect
    to a perl variable and printed with the cgi script.
